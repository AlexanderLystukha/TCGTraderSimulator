# TCG Trader Simulator 🎴

## Overview
Welcome to the TCG Trader Simulator! This is a faithful recreation of the experience of buying, collecting, and unpacking Pokémon cards, inspired by the actual Pokémon TCG collectibles. If you don't have the means to collect physical cards, this simulator recreates that experience as closely as possible—with some extra features you won't find in the real world!

But this simulator is much more than just a trading card shop simulation. You can create custom TCG collecting challenges, design your own cards, or compete to collect the rarest cards possible—all without spending a dime! ✨

## Project Background

This application was developed in an educational environment to learn and demonstrate several key programming concepts:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing classes, inheritance, and design patterns
- **Windows Application Development**: Building desktop applications with WPF and C#
- **UI/UX Design**: Creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces
- **Software Architecture**: Structuring a complex application with multiple features

Beyond the educational goals, I wanted to recreate the joy of buying and unpacking trading cards—an experience I loved as a kid—without any financial consequences. This project combines nostalgia with practical software development skills!
